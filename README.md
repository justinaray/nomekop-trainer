# nomekoP Trainner

University of Maryland CMSC 106 (Fall 1999) Project \#7

## History and Purpose
This is a project I resurrected from my first semester as a CS major at the University of Maryland at College Park.  As I had very little exposure to development before this course, this code is understandably awful.  I am uploading for posterity and as a tool to teach my children some introductory programming.

## Original Project

The original project was designed to teach students structs in the C programming language.  It also built on previous projects that taught C fundamentals, pointers, logic, etc.  The project read a "DB" of nomekoPs and allowed the user some basic listing, searching, and battling features.  The textual interface was best exercised via standard input redirection due to the difficulty of priming the DB at each run.

## Build/Running

# Standard Input History
Unfortunately, I didn't have or backup the original standard inputs that were used to grade this project.  I remember them being brutal.  They were diff'd without whitespace ignore so you had to be meticulous.  A trait that I now recognize as vital to a strong dev!  FWIW, I remember getting an A ;)  I have reverse-engineered some inputs, but will continue to improve this repo so it's more flexible/approachable and fun as a teaching aid.

Compile:

`gcc Project7.c -o dist/Project7.o`

Run:

`./dist/Project7.o < stdInputs/<input-file.txt>`

### Charles Lin

The instructor for this course was Charles Lin.  He was one of the most effective, thorough, and enjoyable instructors I had while at UMD.  I had him for at least 3 courses.  Frankly, he was one of my favorites!

I owe my career to Charles.  He introduced me to Unix, Emac, C, and much more in a few short months.  His teaching style just seemed to resonate with me. It was my introduction to proper development and has lead to a lifetime of personal growth and job satisfaction.

Thanks Charles!
